The cards I choose out of the switch file in cardEffect were council_room, smithy, village, great_hall, and outpost.  
I pulled everything out of them except for case "card name"  and return.  
First I made functions of each other cards and end of the file then called them at the top of the file so that computer wouldn't be confused or kick back warnings.
Now with each of my functions I renamed them with _fn after their regular name.  After doing that I had to instaniate the variables since they were now out of the cardEffect function 
with all the variables already instaniated.
Next I put the main part that I took out of the switch statement underneath part 4.
Lasty for each switch statement I had to adjust my return from 0 to name of the functions for example counil_room I called the function council_room_fn.
So my return looks like this return counil_room_fn(currentPlayer.....);.
