I when I made this tarantula test it was under projectTarantula.py.  
I made it so that it projectTarantula.py ran dominion.c to tarantula.out.
tarantula.out lists the suspiciousness of each line of code to the left of each line.
The suspiciousness was computed using gcove files from running a failing test and a passing test using 
the formula in the lecture.

When I ran projectTarantula.py I got passed test was 46.92% failed out of 558 out of the 1000 I ran and and 53.08% passed out of the 442 out of 1000 passed.  
Which comes down to it i believe more test were ran to fail because some cards are disappearing from 
the game after being played.  So I think the true failed test is actually less than that but
I couldn't get it to adjust.

The failed test are saved under failed_tests.out and the passed tests are saved under passed_tests.out
When it comes my totalfailed or what I expected was actually around 50% and for the totalpassed I was
expecting around 70%.  For the formula for The Tarantula Approach 
suspiciousness = (failed_tests/totalfailed)/(passed_tests/totalpassed)+(failed_tests/totalfailed) I get 
(46.92%/50%)/(53.08%/70%) + (46.92%/50%) = 55.31% suspiciousness.

When you run it you should get failed_tests.out and passed_test.out which will show all the percentages for 
the project.

Also the bug I found in Dominion was in player.c extension of dominion.  It always kicks back a warning
that says control reaches end of non-void funtion when it is not a non-void function.
